# Special Topics- Readme!

### There will be multiple things to install, go through them one by one.

### First things first, install Python in your system. You can download the latest verison (3.10.7) here- 
* For [Windows](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.7/python-3.10.7-amd64.exe).  
* For [macOS](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.6/python-3.10.6-macos11.pkg).
* For [Linux/Unix](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.7/Python-3.10.7.tgz).

## After you open the installer, make sure to check the box which says "Add python to PATH".

### Follow the steps to install python on your computer, restart if you have to.
### To check the version of python you are running, type - `python --version` in your Command Prompt or Terminal.

### Next is your IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Choose the one you're comfortable with. For this project we would recommend Visual Studio Code (VS Code) because it provides a good experience with managing the files that you will be working on. 
### If you are not comfortable with VS Code, you can always download another IDE to work on. But for now, here's the link to download VS Code- 

* For [Windows 8,10,11](https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=win32-x64-user) 
* For [macOS] (https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=darwin-universal)
* For [Linux/Unix] (https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=linux-deb-x64)

> Make sure to install it in C drive so that you don't run into issues later with the libraries.

### Next up is the web framework that we will be working on for this project, Django. This framework makes our work so much easier because its simpler than traditional frameworks like Node.JS and Django uses python which will be much easier for all of us to understand and write the code in.

### To install Django, go to your Command Prompt in Windows, or Terminal in macOS, Linux/Unix. 

### Type in this code to install the latest version of Django (Internet connection needed!)- `pip install Django`.
